Tracks views of all individual articles, even if viewed on front page, category pages and RSS feeds.

== Description ==

Count every viewer and every page impression for each blog entry, no matter how and where it is read: pixelstats tracks views of each blog post or page, not only on a single article page but also on each other page where the complete article is shown, i.e. the blog front page, category pages, search result page, archive pages and even RSS feeds.

Count every view just once: pixelstats can distinguish between recurring and non-recurring views per (anonymous) user to compute a unique or total view count per post/page.

Show off your stats: You can display you view count for each article on your blog.

Analyse your statistics: pixelstats offers comfortable analyzation tools, including graphs, dashboard widget etc.
